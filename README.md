# DevTerm
DevTerm is a custom terminal that adds cool commands.

## Setup
1. Install DevTerm, and run it atleast once.
2. Store dev_term.exe somewhere safe and add that directory to your PATH.
3. Open Windows Terminal, click the down arrow, and select DevTerm from the profiles list
4. Enjoy!<br>
Alternatively you can just directly use dev_term.exe but that's not convenient.
